# Task Management - Personal Extensions (Example)

> This is an example `PERSONAL.md` file for the focus-areas system.
> Copy this to `.cursor/skills/task-management/PERSONAL.md` and customize it.

## My Priority System

I use a focus-area model with traffic light priorities:

| Position | Color | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| #1 | Gold | Weekly focus (special attention) |
| #2-3 | Green | Active priorities |
| #4-5 | Yellow | Important but secondary |
| #6+ | Red | Deferred until higher priorities clear |

## My Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npx tsx ptz.ts show` | Dashboard with traffic light priorities |
| `npx tsx ptz.ts set-weekly-focus <area>` | Set this week's focus (moves to #1) |
| `npx tsx ptz.ts add-task <area> <task>` | Add task to a focus area |
| `npx tsx ptz.ts update-task <area> <task> --status done` | Mark task complete |
| `npx tsx ptz.ts reorder-focus <area> -p <n>` | Change focus area priority |
| `npx tsx ptz.ts check` | Run integrity checks |

## My Rules

- **Maximum 3 in-progress tasks** across all focus areas
- **No in-progress tasks in red zone** (position 6+) - these are deferred
- **Stale task warnings** after 14 days in same status

## My Data File

`priorities.yaml` with this schema:

```yaml
weekly_focus:
  area: "Focus Area Name"
  week_of: 2026-01-26  # Monday of the week

focus_areas:
  - slug: area-slug
    name: "Focus Area Name"
    tasks:
      - slug: task-slug
        name: "Task description"
        status: pending | in_progress | done | blocked
        status_since: 2026-01-26
        due: 2026-02-01      # Optional
        notes: "Context"     # Optional
```

## Weekly Review Process

Each Monday:
1. Run `set-weekly-focus` to designate this week's main area
2. Review red zone tasks - remove or promote as needed
3. Check for stale tasks with `check` command
4. Verify WIP limit is not exceeded
