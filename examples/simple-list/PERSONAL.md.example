# Task Management - Personal Extensions (Example)

> This is an example `PERSONAL.md` file for the simple-list system.
> Copy this to `.cursor/skills/task-management/PERSONAL.md` and customize it.

## My Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npx tsx ptz.ts show` | Dashboard grouped by status |
| `npx tsx ptz.ts add <name>` | Add a new task |
| `npx tsx ptz.ts add <name> --due YYYY-MM-DD` | Add task with due date |
| `npx tsx ptz.ts start <id>` | Mark task as in_progress |
| `npx tsx ptz.ts done <id>` | Mark task as done |
| `npx tsx ptz.ts remove <id>` | Remove a task |
| `npx tsx ptz.ts list --status todo` | List only todo tasks |

## My Data File

`tasks.yaml` with this schema:

```yaml
tasks:
  - id: task-abc1234
    name: "Task description"
    status: todo | in_progress | done
    due: 2026-02-01      # Optional
    notes: "Context"     # Optional
    created: 2026-01-26
```

## My Workflow

1. Add tasks as they come up
2. Run `show` to see current state
3. Use `start` when beginning work
4. Use `done` when finished

## Notes

- Overdue tasks are highlighted in the dashboard
- Tasks are grouped by status (in_progress, todo, done)
- No WIP limits in this simple system
