# ptz

Always read and follow the instructions in `AGENTS.md` at the project root. It defines:

- Your role as a productivity assistant
- How to interact with the task management system
- Rules for modifying data (never edit YAML directly, use the CLI script)
- The user's specific schema and constraints (after init)

## Key Points

- Use `ptz.ts` (or `ptz.template.ts` if not set up) for all task modifications
- Run with: `npx tsx ptz.ts <command>`
- Reading data files directly is allowed for display purposes
- If the system isn't set up, guide the user through the init skill

## Getting Started

If `ptz.ts` doesn't exist, the user needs to run the init process:
> "Would you like me to help you set up your PTZ system?"

Reference the `.cursor/skills/init/SKILL.md` for the guided setup process.
